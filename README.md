## Description
This is a Flask web application that simplifies the process of finding information about movies and TV shows. With just a simple search, you can easily access the most important details of any title, including ratings from TMDB, IMDb, and Rotten Tomatoes, along with a YouTube trailer.

The app was designed to prioritize user-friendliness and efficiency, making sure that only the relevant information is provided to avoid overwhelming the user with data that often leads to time-consuming rabbit holes.

It uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API for searching movies and TV shows and retrieving necessary details about the selected title, and web scraping to get the rating information from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes.

## Features

## Usage
To use this application, you need to run the app.py script. This script takes a title as user input and returns a list of matching results. You can then select a title to get more detailed information.

## Environment Variables
This project uses the following environment variables:

```
# .env file template
# Replace <Your TMDB API key> with your actual TMDB API key without the angle brackets
TMDB_API_KEY=<Your TMDB API key>
```

You need to set these environment variables in a .env file in the project directory.

## Dependencies
This project uses the following Python packages:

- Built-in Python Modules:
    - Flask
    - logging
    - os
    - re

- External Python Modules:
    - **requests:** This package is used to send HTTP requests to the TMDB API and to the IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes websites. It allows the application to communicate with these services and retrieve data.

    - **beautifulsoup4:** This package is used to parse the HTML content returned by the requests to the IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes websites. It allows the application to extract specific pieces of information, such as the IMDb rating, and the Rotten Tomatoes URL and scores.

    - **python-dotenv:** This package is used to load the TMDB_API_KEY environment variable from the .env file in the project directory, which is needed to authenticate the requests to the TMDB API.

    - **unidecode:** This package is used to handle Unicode characters that may be present in the movie and TV show titles. It can convert these characters to their closest ASCII equivalents, which is helpful when dealing with foreign language titles.

    - **quote from urllib.parse:** This function is used to create a percent-encoded string suitable for including in a URL. It's used to sanitize the user input before including it in the URL for the TMDB API request to ensure that the user input doesn't break the URL if it contains special characters.

## Roadmap/Future Enhancements

- Watchlist integration
- 3 Movies/TV show recommendations based on the selected title
- Optimize further for mobile devices
